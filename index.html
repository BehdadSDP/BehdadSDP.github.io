              <p>One of the most critical tasks in computer vision is object detection. While object detection networks have demonstrated high accuracy in normal weather conditions, they are not reliable in adverse weather. To address this issue, we have enhanced a smaller version of YOLOv5, known as YOLOv5s, to be compatible with challenging weather conditions and devices with limited resources. As a result, we modified the YOLOv5s architecture to extract significant features. We used a lightweight transformer network known as MobileViTv2 with an Inverted Residual Block, which is efficient in terms of computational resources. Furthermore, the YOLOv5 Neck has incorporated the C3RFE module to improve feature extraction efficiency in adverse weather. In order to assess the effectiveness of our suggested method, we conducted a thorough evaluation using a Foggy-Cityscape dataset. The results demonstrate that in comparison to the YOLOV5s, the algorithm has a 33% decrease in the number of model parameters and also increases by about 2% in mAP. Comparative analysis demonstrates the algorithm's superiority and effectiveness.</p>

              <p>Recognizing actions in still images remains difficult, even if Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made significant advancements in picture categorization. The main difficulty in recognizing human action from photographs is the lack of visual indications of temporal information in static photos. Presently, the most effective approaches involve training a deep Convolutional Neural Network directly on images for action recognition. Nevertheless, these approaches include numerous parameters and incur substantial computational expenses. Moreover, the majority of existing techniques have utilized supplementary information, such as human body movements, relevant objects, and the visual characteristics of body parts, obtained from photos. These approaches utilize object detection or pose estimation as an auxiliary method in both the training and testing phases. Creating these annotations is a laborious and expensive process. In this paper, we utilize a convolutional neural network (CNN) as the student model, whereas a combination of a larger convolutional neural network (CNN) and a vision transformer (ViT) function as the teacher model. The CNN teacher model collects local picture features, while the ViT teacher emphasizes global features through an attention mechanism. Both local and global features can be advantageous in human action recognition; therefore, we attempt to integrate ViT and CNN teachers to develop the optimal teacher for the student model. This is achieved through a loss-aware module, which adaptively allocates sample-wise reliability to each teacher's prediction based on ground-truth labels, assigning greater weights to predictions that closely match one-hot labels. Our method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 95.17% on the Stanford40 dataset, which is the highest performance.</p>

              <p>Recognizing actions in still images remains difficult, even if Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have made significant advancements in picture categorization. The main difficulty in recognizing human action from photographs is the lack of visual indications of temporal information in static photos. Presently, the most effective approaches involve training a deep Convolutional Neural Network directly on images for action recognition. Nevertheless, these approaches include numerous parameters and incur substantial computational expenses. Moreover, the majority of existing techniques have utilized supplementary information, such as human body movements, relevant objects, and the visual characteristics of body parts, obtained from photos. These approaches utilize object detection or pose estimation as an auxiliary method in both the training and testing phases. Creating these annotations is a laborious and expensive process. In this paper, we propose a knowledge distillation framework to enhance the process of recognizing actions in still images. This framework uses a technique that employs the discriminative classifier from the pre-trained teacher model for direct usage in student inference. Additionally, we train a student encoder by aligning features using a single ℓ2 loss. Also, self-distillation is employed to enhance the performance of instructor networks, hence leading to an increase in the accuracy of student networks. Our framework achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 96.54% on the Stanford40 dataset, which is the highest performance.</p>
